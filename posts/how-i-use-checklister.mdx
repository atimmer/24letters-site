I've just published [checklister](https://checklister.app), my app to create and execute repeatable checklists. It does nothing more, nothing less. I created it because I had my own need for it.

I used to handle these things in OmniFocus. When the script broke I used for creating new projects, I was in limbo for a while. Since AI agents it is much easier to create personal software. So I did that. I've been using this project for while, but wanted to polish it before publishing. That's done now, and you can use it for your repeatable checklists!

I use it for two things: Packing lists and my weekly review checklist.

## Packing lists

I go on different kinds of trips. These trips usually have shared items and unique items. One thing everyone always needs are toiletries, so that's a shared item. That's why I created a composable list feature: packs. With packs you make a smaller list that you can then use within the main checklist template.

Packs look like this when editing a template:

When you create a checklist from this template, the items in the pack and other items in the template are combined into one coherent checklist. This makes for no-distractions checking off:

## Weekly review

This is a much simpler checklist that handles my weekly review. Some of the tasks on there are: looking back, looking to my goals, and planning my week.

The weekly review checklist is inspired by the books Getting Things Done and GRIP. The review keeps me anchored to my goals and allows me to do all the tasks I set for myself.

If you start using checklister too and get some use out of it, let me know!
