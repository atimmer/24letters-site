I got the following notification: "**ðŸš¨ DAILY DEAL: FREE HOTDOG Because you're a member, valid today!**" Now, in general I am not a fan of random notifications to sell me stuff. Even though it's great for the bottom line of the company, it's horrible as a user experience.

I have a bigger issue with this notification though. I'm a vegetarian, so I will never be interested in a hotdog. As a food company, it shouldn't be too hard to glean my dietary preferences, given the amount of total lifetime orders I have.
