As software builders we have tremendous choice in how to present our user inputs. I recently was talking about how I think Moneybird is a 9-9.5 as a product and Exact Online is a 6. [I've written before about Exact breaking the browser back button](https://better-software.ghost.io/exact-online-back-button/). One of the UX examples I cited was the period selector. Let's start with showing you the Exact Online one:

![Exact Online Month Selector](/images/Exact%20Online%20Month%20Selector.png)

![Exact Online Quarter Selector](/images/Exact%20Online%20Quarter%20Selector.png)

It is super basic. You click the period and a dropdown opens. At least the dropdown only closes when you click somewhere else on the page.

If I had no point of comparison, I would say this is ok. I don't regularly think about period selectors, so one could assume this is the best software has to offer. Having said that, the problems start when you want to select multiple quarters. A basic bug is that the dropdown doesn't show the year when it is closed. More fundamentally, I have to consciously think fairly intensely about which quarters I want. Then I realize that I need to put in 1-4 in the text fields. I first tried to write "Q3" and "Q4", but good thing is that the fields are number fields.

Let's compare this to how Moneybird does this same task:

![Moneybird Period Selector](/images/Moneybird%20Period%20Selector.png)

It is instantly clear to me that the current selection is Q1 of 2025. Because of the visual nature of the timeline I don't even have to think about which months are contained in a quarter. While using this selector, I have never had confusion about the period I have selected. It is always clear. The one thing I had to learn is how to change the years that are displayed. The green arrows next to year change the year, which was non-obvious to me when I first learned this selector:

The advantage of this setup is that it also makes arbitrary ranges possible.

Neither control offers support for arbitrary dates. This is expected, because in bookkeeping software reports you really never need arbitrary dates. Nearly all reporting is done on either a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis.

The one drawback I can immediately see of the Moneybird period selector is accessibility. It's exceedingly likely that that one is harder to make accessible. If it even is accessible. I would love to know whether it is accessible, or how an accessible period selector would work.
