The [Resonant Computing Manifesto](https://resonantcomputing.org) lacks soul. The humanness it professes to want it itself actually lacks. When I read it I felt emptyness inside.

At first I only noticed superficial details. Why is it using Times New Roman? Why does the design feel lifeless? Why does the text feel corporate-y?

I started looking inward to see if the problem was me. So I decided I should look at a manifesto that I actually like, [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org). And my first reaction was, I think I know where they go their inspiration from.

And I think what bothers me about the resonant computing manifesto is that it lacks taste. I don't profess to be an amazing writer, but I also don't write a high-in-the-sky manifesto that aims to change the world.

One thing I love about the agile manifesto is this quote:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

This is a statement of the now. A vision is only valid if you live it. The resonant computing manifesto doesn't feel lived to me.

So I'm left with: Just do it. Instead of writing this manifesto just live it. A great example of a group of people that lives it are the people at 37signals [^1]. They just released [Fizzy](https://www.fizzy.do) and it feel thorougly "great human software" to me.

So built something that people actually want and is great tech!

[^1]: I do want to distance myself from some of the politics surrounding some of
the people. I disagree vehemently with some opinions. But oh do they make great
human software. So on that specific area, they are a huge inspiration.
