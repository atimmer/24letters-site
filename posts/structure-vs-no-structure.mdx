title: Structure vs no-structure

I'm trying to use Cursor, as it is supposed to be awesome. Recently I had a simple request: Find the version of TypeScript I was using. So I opened the VSCode settings:
![Cursor Settings](/images/Cursor%20Settings.png)

And searched for TypeScript:
![Cursor Settings 2](/images/Cursor%20Settings%202.png)

Every time I try to do anything in the VSCode settings I become disoriented. The sheer amount of settings overwhelms me every time. Contrast this to the structure in the PyCharm (which includes WebStorm) settings:
![WebStorm Settings](/images/WebStorm%20Settings.png)

As an extra bonus, it highlights the word that you searched. Making it super obvious why this is a result for the query:
![WebStorm Settings 2](/images/WebStorm%20Settings%202.png)

I would love to use Cursor as a daily driver, but so far I've been struggling with the fact that it is VSCode in the end.
