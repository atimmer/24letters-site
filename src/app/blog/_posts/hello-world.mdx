# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using MDX!

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Code Example

Here's an example of a code block:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
