Back in 2010, in highschool, I worked on trying to make an RTS in the browser. Canvas was fairly new and I was super excited about the potential there. "[How do you draw a diagonal line in the browser?](https://youtu.be/S5aJAaGZIvk?t=1124)". Don't skip out on the intro video for Google IO 2009, it was great, a celebration of the web.

This is an archived log of some development blogs I wrote for the project. Newest first.

This is a huge update in case you didn’t notice, the updates in a list:

Canvas goes full-browser, and when the browser goes full screen the canvas goes full screen.
A background, a scrollable map.
A minimap, easy to make. Nice to have.
Performance, performance, performance. Wow, I had some redundant code, can’t believe it.
If you have suggestions for me, add them in the comments of the YouTube video.

I’m so happy, I figured out the problem that I had with the maths I did and now my formation system works. Yay.

Been busy again, a task system is in place. I could do path finding, which is still above my head but it would be easy to make once I have an algorithm to calculate the path.

But now I use the task system to make the units turn and then move and then turn again.

I have tested the extension of my GameObject object by making Infantry, now GameObject has a tank sprite but that will be a white box.

I have also added the basics of an arrow for the flag which will define what direction the units will stand.

I added sprites now, NIIICEE

## March 13, 2010 - HTML RTS test 2

I proceeded on the idea of the HTML5 and JavaScript RTS. I am surprised how clean the code is.

I had to think about my math skillz before I could make the objects turn and stuff but now I did it. I should add collision of sorts.

## March 13, 2010 - HTML5 RTS test 1
