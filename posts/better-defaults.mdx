I've just been annoyed for the umpteenth time by Google Calendar's default to Sunday as the start of the week. When I started looking at the settings, I noticed it got the time & date format wrong too:

The vast majority of Dutch people use: day/month/year, 24:00 notation and Monday as the start of their week. It already knows I am in the Netherlands. How hard is it to default to these settings?
